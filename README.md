# Kaggle_Digit_Recognition-project
This is a Kaggle beginner competition: Digit Recognizer
For more details visit https://www.kaggle.com/aktaruzzaman/digit-reco-aman/data

In this project you are supposed to develope a machine learning algorithm to recognize a hand written digit. 

#Steps
1. Load Data
2. FeatureEngineering: Cleaning+Missing value check
3. Split data
4. Label encoding
5. Reshape
6. train_test split
7. Load Keras CNN model and apply
8. Save output file and submit

This is comperatively easy job as all data sets are clean. In general you need to put 60-80% of your work on FeatureEngineering where you need to clean and prepare data.
